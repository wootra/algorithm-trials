the original question was acending / descening ordered data.
So, it could pass with a simple binary search algorithm.

But I wanted to challenge more,
so I made my own tree - called TensTree/TensNode.

Which have log10(n) complexity to find a value.

this TensTree can be used when the values are integer.
It shows pretty good performance when the value is bigger.
